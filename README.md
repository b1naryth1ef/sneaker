# Sneaker

Sneaker is a **WIP** web-based GCI (Ground Controlled Intercept) interface designed to be used with [Digital Combat Simulator](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/) and a server configured with Tacview's [real-time telemetry](https://www.tacview.net/documentation/realtime/en/).


## Server

Sneaker includes a Go server which bundles the frontend UI and a backend server to handle processing of the real-time ACMI telemetry stream from tacview.
